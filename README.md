Bing Archiver
=============

Downloads high resolution photos of Bingâ€™s picture of the day, and generates a static site.

To only download without generating the static site, run with `--download` and specify a directory.

Photo titles, descriptions, and copyright are added to the EXIF metadata in the high resolution image files.
